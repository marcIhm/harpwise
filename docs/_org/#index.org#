* Summary

A harmonica tool for the command line, using microphone and speaker.

Harpwise supports your harmonica practice with scales, chords and licks.
It offers various tools, an explorable quiz and may guide your jamming.
It can be used with diatonic (richter) or chromatic harmonicas in
different keys.
  
* Screencasts
    
  The screencast below, shows how harpwise (mode 'listen') reacts on notes
  beeing played and how it can help to write them down. No sound has been
  recorded however, so some accustic imagination is required.

  The second screencast is from mode 'quiz', showing three of the many
  flavours: hear-key, players and keep-tempo.

* Introduction

  [[images/harmonica3.png]]

  A harmonica tool for the command line, using microphone and speaker.
  
  Harpwise runs on the command line of Linux, MacOS and WSL2/Windows.
  
  It plays and perceives single notes and can play chords.

  The main operation modes of harpwise are 'listen', 'jamming', 'quiz'
  and 'licks'; these may help to:

  - Learn scales and intervals
  - Jam through a chord progression guided by scales and licks
  - Learn and memorize licks (a few samples included)
  - Train your ear and musical memory and learn related
    music theory by the way of quiz

  Some of the other things, that harpwise can do:

  - Help to find the key of a song (with an adjustable pitch)
  - Interactively play intervals or note progressions
  - Help in writing down a sequence of holes (journal)
  - Work on bends or warbles
  - Transpose a sequence of holes from one key of harp to another
  - Provide an overview table of positions and keys of songs and harp
  - Print notes layed out on a harmonica chart
  - Print or play chords or scales
  - Show full help on its usage

* Installation

  Harpwise is available from the ubuntu-repositories:

  sudo apt install harpwise

  as a debian package; this also works fairly well for WSL2/Windows.
  
  For other variants of linux, you may try:

  sudo snap install harpwise

  (which may require you to enable the snapstore first)

  for other platforms, a more manual install is required; please see the
  README within subdirectory install.
   
* Invocation

  Once you have installed harpwise, go to the commandline and type:

  if you have downloaded from Github:

  - cd ~/harpwise
  - ./harpwise

  or if you installed harpwise from the Ubuntu repositories:

  harpwise

  In either case, harpwise will print a usage information to get you
  started quickly.  Or read below for additional details.

* Getting started

  Get usage information, especially a section on "Quick Start" by invoking
  harpwise without arguments:
  
  ./harpwise


  This will show examples and options for its main operations:
  
  - listen: listen to your playing, e.g. to monitor bends or scales
  - quiz: train your ear, memory and knowledge of music theory with
    many different flavours. This is actually fun and an engaging way
    to start with harpwise.
  - licks: learn licks ! A few are included and some pointers to more
  - play: wise plays scales, holes, licks, chords, intervals, progressions
    or a reference pitch
  - print: print licks, scales, etc. or produce various reports
  - tools: utilities, mostly related to basic harmonica theory
  - samples: record samples for holes or generate them

  As an optional step you may want to create samples for the program; the
  resulting wav-files will be kept in directory ~/harpwise

  Or, to get started quickly you may generate samples and frequencies
  (e.g. for the key of c):

  harpwise samples generate c

  
  If you want to work with mode licks to learn and memorize licks (highly
  recommended !), you will need to add new licks soon.  Add them to your
  own lick-file, which is typically located at:

  ~/harpwise/licks/richter/licks_with_holes.txt

  this file is created on first invocation and filled with only a few
  sample-licks; however it contains extensive instructions on how to add
  new licks and some pointers to sources for more (printed and online,
  payed and free).

* Getting help

  If you have problems, questions or just want to give feedback, please
  drop me a note: marc@ihm.name

  If you have a github-account and prefer a more structured approach, you
  may also open a github-issue.

  In addition harpwise comes with a number of help sources:

  - This README gives some general background and context information
  - The program harpwise comes with a general usage text as well as texts
    specific to each mode. These texts are shown, if harpwise is invoked
    without arguments and contain lots of examples and descriptions for
    invoking harpwise and for the form of its arguments and options.
  - When harpwise is running, especially in its main listen-perspective
    (see screenshots), you can press 'h' to get a short overview of all
    available keys.
  - The main menu facility of harpwise (which, at times, covers the lower
    half of the screen and offers to choose between various items), often
    shows one-line descriptions of its items at the bottom.
  
* Configuration

  This is the user-modifyable configuration file, that will be created on
  first invocation:

  ~/harpwise/config.ini

  There you may override many settings and programs default.  The file is
  commented extensively, so please read there for details on the various
  settings. Initially this config-file is a copy of the programs central
  config-file.

  See also the usage-information, which lists all of the command line
  options, which in many cases mirror the settings from your config.ini.

* Some musical concepts
** Scales

   Scales, e.g. 'blues' or 'major pentatonic' or 'chord-i' are central for
   playing the harmonica. E.g. when improvising, you may stick to a
   specific scale.

   Therefore, harpwise shows information about the scales, that a given
   hole belongs to; it can also play scales or print their content or quiz
   you about them.

   For this to work best, you may:

   - Give the name of your favorite scale as an argument when starting
     harpwise. The default is often 'blues', but you may also use
     e.g. 'mape' (for major pentatonic). Use 'harpwise print scales' to
     learn about the available scales.
   - To include other scales beyound the main scale, you may add the
     option --add-scales on the commandline, e.g.  '--add-scales
     chord-i,chord-iv,chord-v' In many modes of harpwise you may rotate
     among scales by pressing 's'.


   So a typical invocation would be:

   harpwise listen c blues --add-scales chord-i,chord-iv,chord-v

   which shows, which of the four given scales the notes you play belong
   to respectively. This command line may be shortend by moving the option
   --add-scale to your configuration.

   
   The wise already comes with a large set of scales; but if you still miss
   something, you may create your own using the tool make-scale.

   You may even use an adhoc-scale by giving its holes on the commandline;
   see mode listen for an example.

** Licks

   Licks help you to grasp the style and ideas of other players. Harpwise
   allows to build and organize a whole collection of licks. For each lick
   there is a recording and the sequence of holes that (mostly) make it
   up.

   Out of the factory, harpwise only has a few older licks with expired
   copyright and amateur recordings; an example would be a lick from the
   St-Louis blues.

   To work fruitfully with licks, you should record your own or buy some
   decent lick collections (me beeing not connected with any of those).
   See your lick-file for pointers and instructions:

    ~/harpwise/licks/richter/licks_with_holes.txt
    
* Some technical concepts
** The reference hole

   The wise can remember a hole that you have played and later refer to
   it; this is useful e.g. to show the interval between the current hole
   and the reference, or to show the deviation from the currently played
   frequency to the nominal frequency of the hole, e.g. when practicing
   bends.

   To set the reference, you simply play the desired note and hit the key
   'r' at the same time. To clear the reference you just hit 'r' when not
   playing anything.

** When multiple holes produce the same note

   Many harps produce identical notes on certain holes; e.g. the diatonic
   harmonica on holes -2 and +3. There are even more cases e.g. for a
   chromatic harmonica.

   Harpwise cannot distinguish between such holes either and treats them
   alike in all aspects (display, quiz, notation).

   For writing down licks however, you are free to use any of those
   multiple holes.

** Tuning

   The harp wise does not make assumptions about the tuning of your
   harmonica; e.g. it works equally well with 'equal temperament' (ET) or
   'just intonation'.  Simply because, it asks you to play your own harp
   to generate samples (whatever its tuning might be). It then computes
   frequency values from these samples. (Remark: for a quick start you may
   have skipped this step using automatic sample generation)
  
   However, sometimes harpwise has to choose one tuning, e.g. when doing
   sample generation or when your samples need to be judged against some
   standard. In such cases it generally uses 'equal temperament' (ET for
   short).

* A closer look at the Screen

  Please note, that the wise tries to adapt itself to different screen
  (terminal) sizes. If your terminal window supports changing the screen
  size, then harpwise will react accordingly and you do not need to
  restart it.

  You probaby get the best experience if you use a larger font and a
  terminal with a modest size, e.g. 80 cloumns and 25 rows.

  Also note, that harpwise uses figlet to display some information in
  large letters. The optical result of this may vary, and you may get a
  smoother appearance by choosing another font; personally I use 'Lucida
  Console' (at least under WSL2/Windows).

  Now if you start harpwise e.g. in mode listen, or licks or some flavours
  of quiz, you get a screen as shown in the screenshots above.

  Its structure is as follows (top to bottom):

  - Header: topmost 2 lines 
  - The 'display': a larger area taking up most of the upper half of the
    screen
  - The middle part of the screen, three lines in the middle of the screen
  - The 'comment': a larger area taking up most of the lower half of the
    screen
  - Footer: the bottommost 2 Lines

** The header

   Two topmost two lines, that show e.g.
   - The current mission, i.e. what you are supposed to do
   - Immediate feedback on keys beeing pressed or a hint on how to get
     help
   - A summary of the settings mode, type, key and scales

** The 'display'

   This part of the screen (i.e. most of its upper half) shows different
   versions of a harmonica chart as known from textbooks. In addition, the
   holes, that you are playing are highlighted in colours, e.g. according
   to the scale.

   To change the display type 'd' repeatedly or type 'D' to get a menu
   with descriptions.

** The middle part of the screen

   The three middle lines of the screen show:

   - The hole and note, that you are playing and the reference hole, if
     set. In addtion ('Rem') the scales the hole belongs to
   - The Frequency you are playing; featuring a small frequncy gauge
   - The interval of the current hole to the reference hole or to the last
     hole played
        
** The 'comment'

   This part of the screen (i.e. most of its lower half) shows comments;
   e.g. when in mode licks, harpwise expects you to play a sequence of
   holes, the comment-region shows the sequence of holes that you have
   already played or are expected to play.

   To change the comment type 'c' repeatedly or type 'C' to get a menu
   with one-line descriptions.

** The footer

   Within those two lines at the bottom, harpwise shows hints and various
   remarks on its operation.

   For example:
   
   - In mode licks, details about the current lick
   - In mode listen, if idle, notes about famous harp-players

* Usage

  A harmonica tool for the command line, using microphone and speaker.

Harpwise supports your harmonica practice with scales, chords and licks.
It offers various tools, an explorable quiz and may guide your jamming.
It can be used with diatonic (richter) or chromatic harmonicas in
different keys.

A note for beginners: 'richter' is the most common and affordable type
of harmonica and the default for harpwise.  It has 10 holes but no
slider and is also known as the 'blues harp'.  A single harmonica
(e.g. in the key of c or a) is enough to get started.  This program
(harpwise) by itself does not teach you how to play harmonica; rather it
is a tool and meant to be helpful and motivating all along your
learning-journey.  Start with: 'harpwise listen c'.

When invoking harpwise, the first argument on the command line
specifies the mode of operation; it can be one of:

  - listen: The wise listens to your playing (e.g. for scales or
    bends) and helps to steer through a chord progression
  - quiz: Train your ear, memory and knowledge of music theory with
    more than 20 flavours; a fun way to start with harpwise
  - jamming: Scripted jamming along a backing-track
  - licks: Learn licks (some included, pointers for more) as a
    starting point for improvisations

And, less interactive:

  - play: The wise plays scales, holes, licks, intervals, chords, etc.
  - print: Print and annotate the holes or scales or licks given; in
    general everything, that the wise knows about
  - tools: More then 20 tools for various harmonica needs
  - samples: The wise assists in recording your own samples or generates
    them for you; this is a prerequisite for using some other modes, so
    you will be asked to invoke it, when necessary

to read more details, usage examples and options for the individual
modes, invoke them without arguments, e.g.

  #+begin_src 
  harpwise listen
  #+end_src


After the first argument (which specifies the mode) some additional
arguments may be given:

  - type: mostly 'richter' or 'chromatic' but other choices might be
    defined. If omitted, this defaults to 'richter'.

  - key: key of harp, e.g. 'c' or 'g' or 'af' (a flat) or
    'ds' (d sharp). If omitted, this defaults to 'c'.

  - scale: scale on which you want to concentrate, e.g. 'blues',
    'major_pentatonic' or 'all'; defaults to 'blues'.

    Note, that most scales are notated in second position (e.g. key of
    g for a c-harp); you may use the option --transpose-scale to
    change this.

    Harmonica-charts (e.g. in mode listen) show a one-letter shorthand
    of the scale, e.g. 'b' for 'blues'; you may supply your own letter
    after a colon, e.g. 'blues:B', which results in 'B' instead of the
    default 'b' beeing shown.


Some modes (e.g. listen, licks, play) accept additional arguments on
the commandline. See their individual usage messages for details (type
e.g. 'harpwise listen') for details.


An example using all these arguments would be:

  #+begin_src 
  harpwise listen richter c blues
  #+end_src

this does listen to your playing, while marking notes from the
blues-scale.  However, relying on defaults, this could also be written
shorter as:

  #+begin_src 
  harpwise listen blues
  #+end_src

or shorter:

  #+begin_src 
  harpwise listen c
  #+end_src

as 'blues' and 'c' are also the defaults, one might be tempted to
write even shorter:

  #+begin_src 
  harpwise listen
  #+end_src

but that would (on purpose) produce the usage-message of mode listen.


This example would listen especially for the first three notes of the
blues-scale, which are given as arguments and form an adhoc scale:

  #+begin_src 
  harpwise listen -2 -3 +4
  #+end_src


The possible scales depend on the chosen type of harmonica:

  scales for chromatic: all, blues, blues-middle, chord-i, chord-i7, chord-iv, 
    chord-iv7, chord-v, chord-v7, mape, one, two
  scales for richter: all, blues, blues-middle, chord-i, chord-i7, chord-iv, 
    chord-iv7, chord-v, chord-v7, drawbends, major, major-full, 
    major-pentatonic, mape, mape4, mape5, middle, minor, minor-pentatonic, 
    mipe, mixolydian

Note that advanced users may try to create their own scales. See
usage of mode tools for an example.


Besides the arguments for type, key and scale, there are a lot of
options (introduced by '-' or '--'), some requiring an argument
themselves. Options are specific for each mode and are described on
request, i.e. if you give the special option '-o'.

Also note, that for most modes, the behaviour of the wise (e.g. the
ways of display or comment) can be changed interactively; type 'h' to
see help on this.


A Remark on writing holes: The wise supports different types of
harmonica (e.g. richter or chromatic), that may have their own way of
writing holes; however for the most common case of a richter-harp, this
style and examples apply:

- Blow-holes are written with a '+', e.g.:  +1  +6  +3
- Draw-holes with a '-', e.g.:  -9  -2  -3
- Bends (both draw and blow) with a '/', e.g.:  -2/  -3//  +10/
- Comments in '()' or '[]' or starting with '.' or '~' or a single '|'

See the initial lickfile (richter) for more details.


The wise offers a broad set of features that can support your practice for
a long time. However, it also has its limitations: The wise recognizes
single notes and it may play chords for you, but it can not identify your
chords. It knows a bit about tempo, but has no notion of rhythm.

Diagnosis:

  Harpwise uses the excellent program sox (aka play, aka rec) to
  interact with your sound system. Sox handles all playing and
  recording of sounds.

  However, sometimes, sox might not be configured correctly out of the
  box. If you feel, that sox (and therefore harpwise) has problems
  with sound or if you see spurious error messages, you may invoke:

    #+begin_src 
    harpwise tools diag
    #+end_src

  to execute some basic tests and get advice on how to fix common problems.

Quick Start:

  Feedback on holes and notes you play:
  
    #+begin_src 
    harpwise listen c              
    #+end_src

  Improve your harmonica knowledge:

    #+begin_src 
    harpwise quiz random
    #+end_src

  Guided jam along a 12bar-blues:

    #+begin_src 
    harpwise jam along 12
    #+end_src
