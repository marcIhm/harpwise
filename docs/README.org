* Directories

  All dirs, that start with underscore (e.g. _org) can safely be empties, because
  their content is generated on every run.
  
* Basic workflow:

  - Write org in subdir erb-org

  - hw dev doc-proc
    - to process things from erb-org to _org and _txt

  - Load export.el
  - Export with orgmode from _org to _html
    - C-u M-x org-publish
    - project: harpwise
