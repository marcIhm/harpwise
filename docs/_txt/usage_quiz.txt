Overview of 'harpwise quiz':

  The mode 'quiz' is a quiz on music theory, ear and memory. It is
  meant as a fun way to increase your musical abilities. Quiz comes in
  different flavours. It issues questions and asks for an answer. Most
  flavours involve holes beeing played either as part of the question
  or the answer.

  Every time you invoke harpwise with mode 'quiz', a flavour is
  chosen; to try another flavour, just restart harpwise, e.g. by
  pressing ctrl-z.  For a chosen flavour, questions of this flavour
  are asked in an endless loop.

The available 29 flavours are:

    - all, ran, random:
  [2m    all flavours, one at random[0m
    - scales:
  [2m    flavours related with scales at random[0m
    - mic:
  [2m    flavours, that use the microphone; most of them switch to[0m
  [2m    listen-perspective[0m
    - no-mic:
  [2m    flavours, that do not use the microphone, so that no harp is[0m
  [2m    needed; but these flavours are not necessarily silent and may[0m
  [2m    still play sounds themselves[0m
    - silent:
  [2m    flavours, that can be tried with muted speakers, although some[0m
  [2m    of the help might not be as useful[0m
    - inters:
  [2m    flavours, that revolve around intervals[0m
    - layout:
  [2m    flavours, that deal with the layout (holes to notes) of the harp[0m
    - players:
  [2m    harpwise shows details about a famous player and asks for his or[0m
  [2m    her name[0m
    - hear-scale:
  [2m    harpwise plays the holes of a scale and asks for its name[0m
    - not-in-scale:
  [2m    harpwise picks a scale at random and modifies it: holes are[0m
  [2m    shuffled and one is replaced with a foreign hole; this modified[0m
  [2m    scale is played and you should find the foreign hole. The holes[0m
  [2m    are disguised as h1, h2, and so on[0m
    - match-scale:
  [2m    plays a random sequence of holes, that are either a subset of one[0m
  [2m    or many scales and asks for the name of the single or shortest[0m
  [2m    scale containing all these holes[0m
    - play-scale:
  [2m    gives the name of a scale and asks to play it[0m
    - hear-inter:
  [2m    plays an interval and asks for its name[0m
    - add-inter:
  [2m    gives a hole and an interval and asks for the resulting hole,[0m
  [2m    which is obtained by either adding or subtracting[0m
    - play-inter:
  [2m    names a hole and an interval which resolves to a hole; then asks[0m
  [2m    to play back both holes[0m
    - tell-inter:
  [2m    names two holes and asks for the interval between[0m
    - hear-key:
  [2m    picks a random key and its matching note (from octaves 4 or[0m
  [2m    5); plays a sequence of notes starting from this note; asks for[0m
  [2m    the key[0m
    - hear-hole:
  [2m    picks a random key and a named hole-set; then plays a hole from[0m
  [2m    this set and asks for its name[0m
    - play-shifted:
  [2m    wise computes a sequence of holes, that can be shifted by an[0m
  [2m    interval; it plays the original unshifted sequence and names and[0m
  [2m    plays the first hole of the shifted sequence; then you should play[0m
  [2m    BOTH the unshifted and shifted sequence together[0m
    - key-harp-song:
  [2m    gives a key of harmonica and asks for the matching[0m
  [2m    key of song (2nd position) or vice versa[0m
    - hole-note:
  [2m    the wise picks a harp-key then gives a hole and asks for the note[0m
  [2m    or vice versa[0m
    - hole-note-key:
  [2m    picks (and hides) a new key for the harp at random; then, for a[0m
  [2m    named hole-set (e.g. 'blow'), gives holes and matching notes[0m
  [2m    (which depend on the hidden key of harp); then asks for the key[0m
    - hole-hide-note:
  [2m    picks a new key at random and a named hole-set; then shows the[0m
  [2m    hole-set, but hides one note; then asks for the hidden note[0m
    - hear-hole-set:
  [2m    picks a new key at random and a named hole set; then plays it,[0m
  [2m    holes hidden; then asks for the key and the hole set[0m
    - keep-tempo:
  [2m    plays a number of beats defining a certain tempo; then some[0m
  [2m    silence and then some final beats. You are expected to play along[0m
  [2m    and keep the given tempo throughout; harpwise records your playing[0m
  [2m    and checks, how well you kept the tempo[0m
    - hear-tempo:
  [2m    plays a tempo and asks for its bpm[0m
    - replay:
  [2m    harpwise plays a sequence of holes and asks you to play it back[0m
    - hear-chord:
  [2m    taking the harp key as base, the wise chooses a chord (e.g. IV)[0m
  [2m    then it plays the base note as well as the chord. You are expected[0m
  [2m    to identify the chord. For difficulty HARD there are additional[0m
  [2m    chords and for some chords also variations[0m
    - choose:
  [2m    choose flavour interactively[0m
  [2m    (only as extra-argument on commandline)[0m
  
Usage by Examples:

  The wise chooses a quiz-flavour at random (key of c):

    harpwise quiz c random

  this is the preferred way to get used to this mode.

  To switch to a different, random mode, issue signal ctrl-z.


  Some examples that choose a quiz flavour explicitly:
  

  Wise plays 3 notes from the scale major_pentatonic for a
  chromatic harmonica of key a and then asks you to play them
  back (then repeat):

    harpwise quiz chromatic a blues replay 5

  In the examples above, the type of harmonica (e.g. richter or
  chromatic), the key (e.g. c or a) or the number of holes may be
  omitted and are then taken from the config or defaults; so

    harpwise q major replay

  is valid as well (but would choose a richter harp).

  This example removes drawbends from the scale 'all':

    harpwise quiz all replay 5 --remove-scales drawbends

  this example also relies on the default of 5 holes to be played.


  Wise plays a scale and asks you for its name:

    harpwise quiz hear-scale
