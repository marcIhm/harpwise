Overview of 'harpwise print':

The mode 'print' takes its arguments (holes, notes, licks, scales,
semitones or special keywords) and prints them with additional
information.

Moreover it has various reports about the licks or the scales and
intervals that are known harpwise.

If you specify a scale (optional) too, the scale-membership of the the
notes will be shown.

Its argument can be any of:

- holes (e.g. '-1')
- notes (e.g. 'a4')
- semitones (e.g. '+12st')
- licks (e.g. 'st-louis')
- lick progressions
- scales (e.g. 'chord-i')
- scale progressions
- jams
- 'l', '2l', for the last lick, 2nd-to-last, etc.

or one of the known extra arguments (that themselves might require
additional arguments):

- licks-details: all licks currently selected (e.g. by option -t) with
  all details

- licks-list: short list of selected licks (e.g. by option -t) with hole
  count only

- licks-list-all: short list of all licks (disregarding e.g option -t);
  hole count only

- licks-with-tags: list licks (each with its tags) according to the
  various tag-options

- licks-tags-stats: statistics for all known licks and their tags

- licks-history: show, which licks you played recently in mode licks;
  the shortcuts ('l', '2l', ...) from the output can be used as
  arguments to option --start-with

- licks-starred: show all starred licks

- lick-progressions, lick-progs: print all known lick
  progressions. These can be narrowed by giving option -t (this is the
  only case, where this option applies to lick progressions instead of
  licks). Please note, that to print a single lick-progression, you may
  just give its name on the commandline without any extra-keyword

- licks-dump: dump all selected licks in json-format

- holes-history: show, which holes you played recently, from any mode

- scales: For all scales or the scales given as arguments: print them
  with their details; with --brief only liste their names

- scale-progs, scale-progressions: print all known scale progressions

- intervals: print all known intervals

- player, players: print details about players matching argument or a
  list of all known players

- jams: List available jamming-files. This is much like "harpwise jam
  ls", which however has a more relaxed way of specifying the jam.  See
  there for details.



Usage by Examples:

Print lots of information for given holes or notes:

,----
| harpwise print +1 +2 a4 bf5
`----

Map semitones to holes and notes (which are probably more familiar):

,----
| harpwise print +0st +11st -1st
`----

Print holes and notes of a lick:

,----
| harpwise print st-louis
`----

Print holes and notes of a scale (blues):

,----
| harpwise print blues
`----

Print the scales, each note belongs to too:

,----
| harpwise print chord-i feeling-bad --add-scales chord-iv,chord-v
`----

Print the major pentatonic scale but shift it down by 7 semitones:

,----
| harpwise print mape --transpose-scale -7st
`----

nearly the same result can be achieved by

,----
| harpwise print mape
`----

and then take these holes as input for tools:

,----
| harpwise tools shift -7st -2 -3// -3 -4 +5 +6
`----


Print all details for favorite licks:

,----
| harpwise print licks-details --tags-any favorites
`----

(if you have tagged some licks with tag favorites)

or narrow to a lick-progression and reduce amount of output:

,----
| harpwise print licks-details --brief --lick-prog box1
`----


Print a list of licks (only those selected e.g. by -t)

,----
| harpwise print licks-list -t fav
`----

A longer list of all known licks:

,----
| harpwise print licks-list-all
`----


A report showing licks with stats regarding tags:

,----
| harpwise print licks-with-tags
`----

(which might help to find underused or duplicate tags)


Print licks with tags 'fav' first, and then all

,----
| harpwise print licks-tags-stats -t fav
`----

which is (by using defaults) the same as:

,----
| harpwise print richter licks-tags-stats -t fav
`----

If you have collected licks for the chromatic harmonica, you may also
use:

,----
| harpwise print chromatic licks-tags-stats
`----


Show the licks you played recently along with their shortcuts 'l', '2l',
...

,----
| harpwise print licks-history
`----


List all the licks, that you have starred (press '*' in mode licks,
while it is beeing played):

,----
| harpwise print licks-starred
`----

Remark: In other modes you may access these licks through the tag
'starred', which they get assigned automatically.


Show all known scales:

,----
| harpwise print scales
`----


Show the names of all known intervals:

,----
| harpwise print intervals
`----


You may also check out mode tools for some more helpers.


Harpwise comes with a short list of famous players and information about
them; you may request this list to be printed:

,----
| harpwise print players
`----

Or details for a specific player:

,----
| harpwie print player miller
`----

This is the same information, that is printed line by line in mode
listen.
