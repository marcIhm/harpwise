Play either with a mic or use earphones to help harpwise sense your playing even in the presence of the backing track.",

//  After some practice with the backing-track 12bar.mp3 you may want to try one
//  of your own backing-track (e.g. one, that can be found on youtube).
//  For this you will need to prepare another json-file and put in the
//  filename of your new backing-track. In addition you will need to adjust timestamps.
//
//  Admittedly, preparing those timestamps needs some technical work; however, your ear and
//  good tools make this a matter of minutes. Try e.g. audacity and its feature of creating
//  and exporting text-markers.
