You will need to add more licks (with recordings), before the mode
'licks' can really be useful.

To get started you may search the web.  Make sure, to grep audio
samples too or record them yourself. For example, see

  https://www.harmonica.com/6-blues-riffs

for a handful of great licks.

Or visit

  https://www.harmonica.com/25-iconic-harmonica-riffs/

for a collection of famous licks.


Much more extensive are these three books with lots of licks,
complete with audio samples:

- "100 Authentic Blues Harmonica Licks" by Steve Cohen

- "101 Hot Harmonica Licks" by Sandy Weltman

- "100 Easy Blues Harmonica Licks" by Yvonnick Prene 


Also, Liam Ward has useful collections of licks for various skill
levels at:

Not beeing connected with any of these offerings, I found these paid
source invaluable in collecting the 60 or so favorite licks, that I am
practicing regularly.

Of course there are a lot of excellent licks available on the web for
free, so that over time you may build a great library. An excellent
starting point would be Jason Ricci and his great lesson on the
"T-Bone Shuffle": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGFfLe2tWBw


Note, that When adding licks to this file by copying them from a book or
from the web, you probably will need to adjust the notation for holes.
Maybe the "harpwise tool translate" can help with this.
