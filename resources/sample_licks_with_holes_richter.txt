#  ***  ABOUT THE REST OF THIS FILE  ***

#
# The rest of this file contains comments only; they are on two
# different topics:
#
#  - On getting more licks
#
#  - Advanced Features in this file: Defaults and Variables
#


#
#  ***  ON GETTING MORE LICKS  ***
#
<%= lick_sources.map {|l| "# #{l}"}.join %>


#
#  ***  ADVANCED FEATURES IN THIS FILE: DEFAULTS AND VARIABLES  ***
#

# The rest of this file is commented out (with '## '), so it does
# not add anything to your library of licks. But by reading it,
# you may more fully understand the format used and the features
# available. This can be useful, if managing lots of licks
# becomes cumbersome ...

#
# Once you have defined more than a dozen licks (recommended !),
# you may or may not want to reduce typing effort when adding a
# new lick. This can be done by setting some default-information
# and reusing it in many licks.
#
# To this end there are two Special sections:
#
#   [vars]     defining global variables to be used in tags;
#              this may help to save some typing.
#   [default]  define values, that will be included in any lick;
#              only allowed, for tags; in an individual lick you
#              may override or add to this.
#
# both sections are totally optional, so you may just omit them
# at start, or if you find them confusing.


## [default]
##   # This applies for all licks until overwritten by another [default];
##   # tags specified in the individual lick will be added
##   tags = samples
##   desc = some text that should appear in all licks below
##   desc.add = more text we intend to overwrite in some licks below
## 
## [special]
## 
##   # A lick requires a series of holes ('holes =') to be played.
##   #
##   # Beside normal playable holes (e.g. '-2'), a lick may also contain	   
##   # various forms of inline-comments. As explained by examples:		   
##   # 									   
##   # - '[+123]' : Any text in brackets. This example it would be the	   
##   #   hint to play a blow-chord on holes 1, 2 and 3. By convention		   
##   #   brackets can be used to write down things that harpwise cannot		   
##   #   recognize or play (like chords), but which need to be played on	   
##   #   their own.								   
##   # - '(slow)' : Any text in parens. In this example the advice to play	   
##   #   slowly. By conventions parens can be used to note hints on how to	   
##   #   play the notes written before or after.				   
##   # - '.' or '.2beats' : A single dot ('.') or any word starting with a	   
##   #   dot. This can be used just like parens for any kind of comment, but	   
##   #   especially the single dot lends itself to mark pauses.		   
##   # - '~' or '~slide' : A single tilde ('~') or any word starting with a	   
##   #   tilde. This can be used just like parens for any kind of comment,	   
##   #   but especially the single tilde lends itself to mark a slide across	   
##   #   the harmonica or the gradual lift of a bend.
##   # - A single ',' e.g. to mark sections in a longer lick.
##   # 
##   # Please note, that parens, brackets and tilde might need to be quoted,
##   # when used on the commandline which is not needed in the lickfile.
##   # 									   
##   # Remark: An exception of the general rule that comments are ignored	   
##   # would be e.g. '+1 (0.4s)'. Harpwise would take this as an instruction	   
##   # to play the hole +1 for 0.4 seconds.                           
##   # 
## 
##   holes = -1 +1 -2 (pull) -1
##   # This tag adds a tag to those given by the defaults
##   tags.add = advanced
##   # You may also add to the description
##   desc.add = Notice the pull
##   # unfortunately no recording
##

##   tags = scales $source
