play:
  licks: |
    all licks selected (e.g. by option -t). Add option '--lick-radio'
    to make harpwise play licks without interruption (but repeats);
    as an optional argument you may give the number of repeats
  pitch: |
    play an interactive, adjustable pitch; this may help to find the
    key of a song by ear-comparison; the initial key, e.g. 'a4' can be
    supplied as an optional argument
  interval, inter: |
    interactive, adjustable interval given as arguments
  progression, prog: |
    take a base and some semitone diffs, then play it in a loop,
    allowing e.g. to shift each iteration by some semitones e.g.
    through a chord-progression of i-iv-v. Moreover you may specify
    two or more progressions with a dot (.) between; those can then
    be switched for each iteration.
  chord: |
    play the given holes or notes simultanously as a chord; also
    useful for tongue-splits.
  user: |
    play back (if any), what you (the user) have recorded in mode
    'licks' before
print:
  licks-details: |
    all licks currently selected (e.g. by option -t) with all details
  licks-list: |
    short list of selected licks (e.g. by option -t) with hole count only
  licks-list-all: |
    short list of all licks (disregarding e.g option -t); hole count only
  licks-with-tags: |
    list licks (each with its tags) according to the various tag-options
  licks-tags-stats: |
    statistics for all known licks and their tags
  licks-history: |
    show, which licks you played recently in mode licks; the shortcuts
    ('l', '2l', ...) from the output can be used as arguments to
    option --start-with
  licks-starred: |
    show all starred licks
  lick-progressions, lick-progs: |
    print all known lick progressions. These can be narrowed by giving
    option -t (this is the only case, where this option applies to
    lick progressions instead of licks). Please note, that to print a
    single lick-progression, you may just give its name on the
    commandline without any extra-keyword
  licks-dump: |
    dump all selected licks in json-format
  holes-history: |
    show, which holes you played recently, from any mode
  scales: |
    For all scales or the scales given as arguments: print them with
    their details; with --brief only liste their names
  scale-progs, scale-progressions: |
    print all known scale progressions
  intervals: |
    print all known intervals
  player, players: |
    print details about players matching argument or a list of all
    known players
  jams: |
    List available jamming-files. This is much like "harpwise jam ls",
    which however has a more relaxed way of specifying the jam.
    See there for details.
tools:
  transpose: |
    transpose a sequence of holes between keys
  shift: |
    shift a sequence of holes or notes or a single lick by the given
    number of semitones (first argument)
  shift-to-groups: |
    Starts off like 'shift' (see there), but also shows groups of
    alternative holes, that give the same note only in different
    octaves. This can be useful to find variations of a
    hole-sequences, e.g. for improvisation
  keys: |
    For a diatonic harmonica: print a chart with keys and positions
    centered around current key; this tool accepts two optional extra
    arguments, which control coloured emphasis in the otherwise fixed
    chart.  The first argument is the key of the song, the second the
    key of the harp; use '.' to skip emphasising the song.

    Use option --brief to print a version shortend to the most common
    keys and position.
  spread-notes: |
    take a list of notes (e.g. a, a4, b, cs) as arguments and turn
    them into a list of holes that produce them. As the octave is
    deliberately not taken into account, you may give "a" as an
    argument just as well as "a4". Also shows these holes in the
    harmonica chart. When invoked with option --brief, this tool can
    be used as a subcommand on the commandline, in which case it just
    returns the list of holes, to be used e.g. as an adhoc-scale.
  make-scale: |
    accepts a list of holes on the commandline, asks some additional
    questions and writes a new user-defined scale.
  chart: |
    various harmonica charts for current key; add option --ref for
    more charts. If you supply holes or notes as arguments (optional),
    only these are printed in the chart of holes and the other charts
    are skipped.
  notes-major, notes: |
    print notes of major scale for given key
  progression, prog: |
    take a base and some semitone diffs, then spell them out
  interval, inter: |
    calculate and print interval between two notes
  chords: |
    print chords i, iv and v for current key
  transcribe: |
    transcribe given audio-file approximately
  search-holes-in-licks: |
    search given sequence of holes (or equiv) in all licks; the same
    ordering of holes is required; this can help to find licks that
    expand on a given sequence of holes
  search-lick-in-scales: |
    search given lick or sequence of holes (or equiv) in all scales;
    ordering of holes is not important; this may give an idea, to which
    of all scales a given lick can be played. See also the somewhat
    inverse tool search-scale-in-licks.
  search-scale-in-licks: |
    search given scale in all licks; this computes the uniq holes of a
    lick and, taking away 0,1,2 ... holes, checks if the remaining holes
    are contained in the scale.  This can give an idea, which licks can
    be played over the given scale (e.g. chord-iv). See also the very
    similar tool licks-from-scale and the somewhat inverse
    search-lick-in-scales.
  licks-from-scale: |
    For all licks, find percentage of holes, that are taken from the
    given scale and group and sort them accordingly.  This may give an
    idea, which of all licks can be played over the given scale
    (e.g. chord-i or blues). See also the very similar tool
    seach-scale-in-licks.
  translate: |
    Recognize and translate alternate harmonica notations into the
    format required for harpwise; e.g. turn "2 (2) 3" into "+2 -2 +3";
    Currently this is optimized for diatonic harmonicas.
  utils, utilities: |
    Describe some utilities, that come with harpwise and need
    to be invoked seperately.
  edit, edit-licks: |
    invoke editor on your lickfile
    optionally add name of lick or lick-progression to land on
  edit-config: |
    invoke editor on your personal config file
    <%= $early_conf[:config_file_user] %>
  edit-jam: |
    edit given jamming-file. This is much like "harpwise jam edit",
    which however has a more relaxed way of specifying the jam.
    See there for details.
  diag, diag1: |
    help to diagnose problems with your sound system; i.e.
    check that recording and replay work properly.
  diag2: |
    check that mp3 can be played without problems.
  diag3: |
    check that frequencies picked up by your microphone can be
    recognized properly; for this the check 'diag1' should have
    been performed sucessfully first.
  diag-hints: |
    read technical hints on how to fix some of the problems, that
    might have come up with the other diag-tools.
quiz:
  all, ran, random: |

  scales: |
    flavours related with scales at random
  mic: |
    flavours, that use the microphone; most of them switch to
    listen-perspective
  no-mic: |
    flavours, that do not use the microphone, so that no harp is
    needed; but these flavours are not necessarily silent and may
    still play sounds themselves
  silent: |
    flavours, that can be tried with muted speakers, although some
    of the help might not be as useful
  inters: |
    flavours, that revolve around intervals
  layout: |
    flavours, that deal with the layout (holes to notes) of the harp
  players: |
    harpwise shows details about a famous player and asks for his or
    her name
  hear-scale: |
    harpwise plays the holes of a scale and asks for its name
  not-in-scale: |
    harpwise picks a scale at random and modifies it: holes are
    shuffled and one is replaced with a foreign hole; this modified
    scale is played and you should find the foreign hole. The holes
    are disguised as h1, h2, and so on
  match-scale: |
    plays a random sequence of holes, that are either a subset of one
    or many scales and asks for the name of the single or shortest
    scale containing all these holes
  play-scale: |
    gives the name of a scale and asks to play it
  hear-inter: |
    plays an interval and asks for its name
  add-inter: |
    gives a hole and an interval and asks for the resulting hole,
    which is obtained by either adding or subtracting
  play-inter: |
    names a hole and an interval which resolves to a hole; then asks
    to play back both holes
  tell-inter: |
    names two holes and asks for the interval between
  hear-key: |
    picks a random key and its matching note (from octaves 4 or
    5); plays a sequence of notes starting from this note; asks for
    the key
  hear-hole: |
    picks a random key and a named hole-set; then plays a hole from
    this set and asks for its name
  play-shifted: |
    wise computes a sequence of holes, that can be shifted by an
    interval; it plays the original unshifted sequence and names and
    plays the first hole of the shifted sequence; then you should play
    BOTH the unshifted and shifted sequence together
  key-harp-song: |
    gives a key of harmonica and asks for the matching
    key of song (2nd position) or vice versa
  hole-note: |
    the wise picks a harp-key then gives a hole and asks for the note
    or vice versa
  hole-note-key: |
    picks (and hides) a new key for the harp at random; then, for a
    named hole-set (e.g. 'blow'), gives holes and matching notes
    (which depend on the hidden key of harp); then asks for the key
  hole-hide-note: |
    picks a new key at random and a named hole-set; then shows the
    hole-set, but hides one note; then asks for the hidden note
  hear-hole-set: |
    picks a new key at random and a named hole set; then plays it,
    holes hidden; then asks for the key and the hole set
  keep-tempo: |
    plays a number of beats defining a certain tempo; then some
    silence and then some final beats. You are expected to play along
    and keep the given tempo throughout; harpwise records your playing
    and checks, how well you kept the tempo
  hear-tempo: |
    plays a tempo and asks for its bpm
  replay: |
    harpwise plays a sequence of holes and asks you to play it back
  hear-chord: |
    taking the harp key as base, the wise chooses a chord (e.g. IV)
    then it plays the base note as well as the chord. You are expected
    to identify the chord. For difficulty HARD there are additional
    chords and for some chords also variations
  choose: |
    choose flavour interactively
    (only as extra-argument on commandline)
samples:
  record: |
    harpwise assists while you play the holes for the given type and
    key of harmonica. After each recording you may hear back and trim.
    
    These samples capture your style of playing and the specific sound
    of your harmonica as far as possible and brings them into
    harpwise. This way of creating samples gives more interesting
    results than 'generate' but requires some work from your side;
    consider recording the most important keys (or even holes) first
    and use 'generate' for the others. Even 'generate all', as your
    recordings would not be overwritten.

    To redo the recording for a single hole, give it as an argument on
    the commandline.

    You may even combine this method of recording hole-samples with
    'generate', as your recorded samples will be kept and preferred
    over generated samples unless you explicitly use the extra-command
    'delete'.
  generate: |
    as a faster alternative to 'record', you may let harpwise generate
    samples for each hole.  This gives fast results, that, however
    lack the typical harmonica sound.  You may try different waveforms
    (e.g. 'sine') with option --wave (with a default of 'pluck').

    To generate samples for all keys in one pass, you may give 'all'
    as an additional argument; otherwise samples are created for the
    current key only.

    'generate' never overwrites samples that you play during 'record';
    use 'delete' for this, if required.
  check: |
    For the current type and key of harmonica, check out and summarize
    available samples; especially show, which samples have been
    recorded and which ones generated. Use 'all' to get a summary for
    each and every key.
  delete: |
    For the current key, ask for confirmation to delete your recorded
    samples, if any. As these recorded samples had precedence over any
    generated samples, this might be necessary to make harpwise use
    the generated samples (or maybe suggest to use 'generate' first).
    
    This can be useful, if you prefer the (maybe) more precise samples
    that harpwise generates.

    By giving the argument 'all' you may delete all samples for all
    keys.
jamming:
  along: |
    Start the jamming; this matches its arguments
    against known files and starts the jamming; an example would be:

      harpwise jam along 12

    which would pick the pre-installed file '12bar'. If you have many
    jamming-files of your own, you may give longer or more words to make
    selection uniq.

    Please note, that this kind of fuzzy selection applies to other
    extra-commands within mode jamming too.
  list, ls: |
    list available jamming-files with date of last usage and any stored
    processing notes.

    You may also add arguments to name a single file, in which case the
    comment and additional details will be shown too.

    If you give the argument 'all' alone, details for all files will
    be printed.
  play: |
    Play the given backing-track; can be useful if you want to search
    for a matching lick-progression before starting to jam.

    Also useful when creating a new json for jamming, because it
    allows to create a list of timestamps.

    For this purpose you may even give the path to a simple .mp3-file
    which will be played, thus allowing you to mark timestamps; so
    no need to create a json-file up front.
  edit: |
    edit given jamming-file (fuzzy selection)
  notes, note: |
    For the given jamming-file Invoke your editor to enter or edit the
    notes, that will be shown in "harpwise jam list".

    An empty (or whitespace only) note will be removed altogether.
