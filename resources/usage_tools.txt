Overview:

  The mode 'tools' offers some non-interactive but useful utilities,
  which are mostly related to basic harmonica theory; they do not use
  microphone or speaker.

  The required additional argument specifies the tool to run;
  it can be one of:

<%= get_extra_desc_all(for_usage: true).join("\n") %>
  

Usage by Examples:

  Transpose a sequence of notes (some specified as holes) from
  the key of c to g (keeping the notes/pitches constant):

    harpwise tools transpose c g -1 +2 -3

  when playing the result on the g-harp you will have the exact same
  pitches as on the original c-harp.


  Shift a sequence of holes up 12 semitones:

    harpwise tools shift 12st -1 +2 -3

  This is different from transposing the notes/pitches as given
  before, as it changes the pitches of the notes.

  You may then let harpwise play the resulting notes, even if they
  have no hole on the harp (with mode play)


  Print a simple table of keys and positions:
  
    harpwise tools keys

  Center the semitone-column around a specific key of harp (bf) and
  mark it in the table:

    harpwise tools keys bf

  The same and mark a key of song (d) too:

    harpwise tools keys bf d

  If you have a g-harp and want to know what song-keys and positions
  are available:

    harpwise tools keys g g
    

  Print a harmonica chart for the key of g:

    harpwise tools chart g

  The same chart, but with arguments rearranged

    harpwise tools g chart
    
  Two charts, the second with scale-content (chord-i)

    harpwise tools g chord-i chart --add-scales -

  Four charts, the third and fourth with intervals of each hole to the
  given reference:

    harpwise tools chord-i chart --ref -4


  How to get the holes of the pentatonic scale in an adhoc fashion:
  Assuming, that you know its notes  g a b d e:

    harpwise tools spread-keys g a b d e

  the resulting long list of 16 holes may then be used as an adhoc
  scale for mode listen.


  The notes of the major scale starting at c:

    harpwise tools notes c

  this also gives the notes of the major scale one fifth down,
  i.e. starting at f, so that you may follow the circle of fifths in
  both directions if you wish.


  Print a note progression:

    harpwise tools prog e3 7st 9st oct

  which will give you all the notes starting at e3 and the 7, 9, 12
  semitones up.
    

  Print the interval over the base note:

    harpwise tools interval c4 oct

    harpwise tools interval c4 +12st


  print the chords i, iv and v for the current key:

    harpwise tools chords


  Transcribe and audio-file given on the commandline approximately:

    harpwise tools transcribe wade.mp3

  for simple harmonica content this will give you sequence of holes
  played in lick wade.mp3 (from current working dir)
