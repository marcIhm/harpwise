add_scales:
  - |
    load these additional scales,
    given as a list of scales separated by comma.
    and show them, e.g. in harmonica-chart in upper half of screen.

    Note, that this option can be specified in your config.

    Unlike the quite similar option --scale-progression (available for
    modes listen and licks), this option (--add-scales) is not
    primarily meant to accompany you through the progression of a
    song, but rather to adjust the harp-display. Also note, that both
    of these options, when given, do adjust the respective other to
    match, therefore it is enough to specify one of them only.
  - LIST_OF_SCALES

remove_scales:
  - |
    subtract the holes of
    these scales from the primary one
  - SCALE1,SCALE2,...

no_add_holes:
  - |
    for holes from the primary scale, take remarks,
    colors and scale-name from the additional scales; but 
    do not add any new holes
    
transpose_scale:
  - |
    transpose the scale to given
    key (e.g. d) or by semitones (e.g. 12st).  This would be helpful,
    if you want to practice e.g. the d-major scale on a chromatic
    harmonica of key c. Or if you want to play e.g. in third position,
    you may transpose by 7st (= perfect fifth), as the scales are
    generally notated in second position.  In any case: for a diatonic
    harmonica your mileage may vary, as not all notes are available

tags_all:
  - |
    filter licks and keep those
    having ALL of the given tags. For a single tag, this option
    has the same effect as --tags-any
  - TAG1,TAG2,...

    having ANY of the given tags (example: --tags-any scales,classic).
  - TAG1,TAG2,...
    
drop_tags_all:
  - |
    filter licks and drop those
    having ALL of the given tags. For a single tag, this option has the
    same effect as --drop-tags-any
  - TAG1,TAG2,...

drop_tags_any:
  - |
    filter licks and drop those
    having ANY of the given tags
  - TAG1,TAG2,...

max_holes:

    filter licks and keep those, that have
    at maximum this number of holes
  - NUMBER

min_holes:
  - |
    filter licks and keep those, that have
    at minimum this number of holes
  - NUMBER
  
holes:
  - play the sequence of holes, even if a sample is available
  
reverse:
  - play the sequence of holes but reverse it first
  
start_with:
  - |
    the name of the first lick to play;
    accepts the special values 'last' or 'l' to repeat the last lick
    (2l, 3l for earlier licks). Use 'harpwise print licks-history' to 
    get a list of recent licks (including shortcuts like '3l')
  - LICK_OR_L

iterate:
  - |
    how to iterate through all
    selected licks; this can be either 'random' (pick licks at random)
    or 'cycle' (one lick after the other and then again). Both can be
    abbreviated, the default is 'random'.
  - RANDOM_OR_CYCLE

partial:
  - |
    to make the mode 'licks' more
    challenging and to improve the learning result, you may let only
    parts of the recording be played.

    Examples for this option are:

      --partial 1/3@b, 1/4@x or 1/2@e, which would
      play: the first third of the recording, any randomly chosen
      quarter (1/4) of it or the last half (but at least one
      second). 
 
      --partial 1@b, 1@e or 2@x play the given number of
      seconds or holes (1 or 2) at the given position (b=begin,
      x=random, e=end) 

      as a special case --part 0 plays nothing initially.

      This can also be abbreviated as -p 0 and memorized as 'play
      nothing' initially; but of course, when the mode has started,
      you may always request a replay with '.'.
  - PARTIAL_SPEC
  
time_slice:
  - |
    time slice (one of short,
    medium, long) for sensing holes played. In each time slice a
    predefined number of holes can be recognized. The default value is
    'medium', but if your computer is slow, 'long' might be more
    appropriate. If your computer is fast, 'short' might work too,
    which will allow harpwise to follow your playing faster
    (e.g. during warbles).

    However, if you choose 'short' and your computer cannot keep up,
    harpwise will lag behind and show holes only (long) after you have
    played them; in such cases harpwise will issue a warning message
    now and then.

    If lagging occurs, you will get a detailed message on program
    termination, that will allow to judge the situation.
  - SHORT_MEDIUM_LONG

viewer:
  - |
    Viewer for images (e.g. of players); can be
    'none' or one of the external programs 'feh' or 'chafa'
    which need to be installed first.
  - NONE_FEH_CHAFA
  
terse:
  - |
    Be somewhat less verbose than usual. The exact effect
    (if any) depends on the subcommand chosen.
  
scale_over_lick:
  - |
    Interpret a given name as a scale
    if it is known as a scale as well as a lick.  By default such a
    name would be treated as a lick.

read_fifo:
  - |
    When in the main listen-perspective,
    read keys from fifo /tmp/harpwise_fifo too.  This can be useful
    when automizing certain aspects of its operation. The name of the
    fifo is fixed.

difficulty:
  - |
    Difficulty of questions asked;
    if you should identify or reproduce one of a set of choices
    (e.g. when hearing intervals), the difficulty usually gives the
    size of the set. A percentage value between 0 an 100, chooses easy
    or hard at random, with e.g. 20 meaning one time in five (i.e. at
    a rate of 20%) 'hard' and four times 'easy'; so larger numbers are
    harder and 100 would be all 'hard'. This option defaults to
    'easy'.
  - EASY_OR_HARD_OR_PERCENT

sharps:
  - |
    When printing notes, prefer sharps (e.g. as)
    
flats:
  - |
    When printing notes, prefer flats (e.g. bf)
    
options:
  - |
    show full list of mode specific options

scale_prog:
  - |
    Specify a
    list of scales separated by comma, that will be cycled when
    pressing 's'. Only long names of scales are supported here
    (e.g. 'chord-i7', but not '1'). Note, that the standard chords are
    available as scales, so this can be seen as defining a chord
    progression. By default (i.e. if you omit this option) this
    progression would be the main scale and any additional scales
    given by --add-scales.

    The standard 12-bar blues would be:

      --scale-progression 
         chord-i7,chord-iv7,chord-i7,chord-v7,chord-iv7,chord-i7

    which wraps around and does not need to specify, the varying
    length of the different scales / chords, because you have to press
    's' at the right point in time.

    There are some predefined progressions (like '12bar' for the
    example above), that you may learn about by invoking

      harpwise print sclae-progressions

    Note, that this option can not be specified in your config.

    Unlike the quite similar option --add-scales (available for most
    modes and meant to adjust the harp-display), this option
    (--scale-progression) is primarily meant to accompany you through
    the progression of a song. Also note, that both of these options,
    when given, do adjust the respective other, therefore it is enough
    to specify one of them only.
  - LIST_OF_SCALES

lick_prog:
  - |
    Accepts the name <% if $mode == :listen %>
    show given licks in comment
    (lower part of screen), e.g.
    
      --lick-prog wade,simple-turn

    multiple licks may be separated by comma. These licks can be
    played by pressing '.'. You may e.g. want to specify licks for the
    individual chords and/or turnaround licks this way.

    To use a lick progression defined in your lick file, give (e.g.):

      --lick-prog box1-turn<% else %>
    of a lick progression as defined within your lick-file; the licks
    from this progression will then be cycled in mode licks.

      --lick-prog my-lick-progression

    If you use this option, the tag-options for lick-selection are
    ignored.

    Note, that an adhoc lick-progression can always be given as
    arguments on the commandline (space separated) without even using
    this option.<% end %>

no_player_info:
  - |
    Do not print player infos in background

keyboard_translate:
  - |
    translate keys
    from your keyboard into other keys; this is for the main
    listen-perspective only.

    E.g. for mode listen, by giving:

      --keyboard-translate TAB=s,RETURN=r

    harpwise accepts the TAB key (which has otherwise no function in
    this mode) and behaves, as if the key 's' has been pressed; in the
    same way it treats RETURN as 'r'. The benefit of this is, that the
    new keys might be easier to press while playing.

    Beware and make sure, that you dont translate keys, that already
    have an important function in harpwise (e.g. 'RETURN=r' for mode
    licks), because these keys would no longer be available for their
    original function.

    Regarding the available names, let the error message be
    your guide (i.e. type: --kb-tr x). If you want to translate
    permanently, you may (as with many options) put it into your
    config.

    In some cases it might be useful to make two keys out of one:

      --kb-tr b=s,b=RETURN

    see usage of mode licks where this is used to switch
    lick-progression and scale-progression at once by pressing 'b'.
