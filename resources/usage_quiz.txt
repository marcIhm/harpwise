Overview of 'harpwise quiz':

  The mode 'quiz' is a quiz on music theory, ear and memory. It is
  meant as a fun way to increase your musical abilities. Quiz comes in
  different flavours. It issues questions and asks for an answer. Most
  flavours involve holes beeing played either as part of the question
  or the answer.

  Every time you invoke harpwise with mode 'quiz', a flavour is
  chosen; to try another flavour, just restart harpwise, e.g. by
  pressing ctrl-z.  For a chosen flavour, questions of this flavour
  are asked in an endless loop.

The available <%= $extras_joined_to_desc[:quiz].length %> flavours are:

<%= get_extra_desc_all(for_usage: true).join("\n") %>
  
Usage by Examples:

  The wise chooses a quiz-flavour at random (key of c):

    harpwise quiz c random

  this is the preferred way to get used to this mode.

  To switch to a different, random mode, issue signal ctrl-z.


  Some examples that choose a quiz flavour explicitly:
  

  Wise plays 3 notes from the scale major_pentatonic for a
  chromatic harmonica of key a and then asks you to play them
  back (then repeat):

    harpwise quiz chromatic a blues replay 5

  In the examples above, the type of harmonica (e.g. richter or
  chromatic), the key (e.g. c or a) or the number of holes may be
  omitted and are then taken from the config or defaults; so

    harpwise q major replay

  is valid as well (but would choose a richter harp).

  This example removes drawbends from the scale 'all':

    harpwise quiz all replay 5 --remove-scales drawbends

  this example also relies on the default of 5 holes to be played.


  Wise plays a scale and asks you for its name:

    harpwise quiz hear-scale
