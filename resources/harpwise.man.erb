.SH "NAME"

.B harpwise
- practice harmonica with your microphone and speaker

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.B harpwise
.RB {MODE}
.RB {ARGUMENTS}
.RB [OPTIONS]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B harpwise
('wise' for short) supports the daily practice of scales,
intervals, licks or bends on a diatonic (richter) or chromatic
harmonica for various keys.

The primary documentation of harpwise is its usage information, that
can be retrieved by calling it without arguments:
.IP
harpwise
.RE

this man page has the very same information (so you may keep on
reading ...); but there are more usage information for the individual
modes, which are not available as man-pages (see below, on how to get
them).

.SH "MODE"

When invoking harpwise, the first argument on the commandline
specifies the mode of operation; it can be one of:
.IP - 2
.B listen:
The wise listens to your playing (e.g. for scales or bends)
and helps to steer through a chord progression
.IP -
.B quiz:
Train your ear, memory and knowledge of music theory with many
different flavours. This is actually a fun way to start.
.IP -
.B licks: 
Learn licks (some included, pointers for more) as a
starting point for improvisations.
.IP -
.B jamming:
Scripted jamming along a backing-track.
.RE

And, less interactive:

.IP - 2
.B play: 
Wise plays scales, holes, licks, intervals, chords, etc.
.IP -
.B print:
print and annotate the holes of scales or licks given on the commandline.
Also print various informationo about licks, scales and much more
.IP -
.B tools: 
Some non-interactive tools related to basic harmonica theory		
.IP -
.B samples:
The wise assists in recording your own samples or generates them for
you; this is a prerequisite for using many other modes, so you will be
asked to invoke it, when necessary
.RE

to read more details, usage examples and options for the individual
modes, invoke them without arguments, e.g.
.IP
harpwise listen
.RE

.SH "ARGUMENTS"

After the first argument (which specifies the mode) some additional
arguments may be given:
.IP - 2
.B type:
mostly 'richter' or 'chromatic' but other choices might be defined. If
omitted, this defaults to 'richter'.
.IP -
.B KEY: 
key of harp, e.g. 'c' or 'g' or 'af' (a flat) or 'ds' (d sharp). If
omitted, this defaults to 'c'.
.IP -
.B SCALE:
scale on which you want to concentrate, e.g. 'blues', 'major_pentatonic'
or 'all'; defaults to 'blues'.

Note, that most scales are notated in second position (e.g. key of g
for a c-harp); you may use the option --transpose-scale to change
this.

Harmonica-charts (e.g. in mode listen) show a one-letter shorthand
of the scale, e.g. 'b' for 'blues'; you may supply your own letter
after a colon, e.g. 'blues:B', which results in 'B' instead of the
default 'b' beeing shown.
.RE

Some modes (e.g. listen, licks, play) accept additional arguments on
the commandline. See their individual usage messages for details (type
e.g. 'harpwise listen') for details.

An example using all these arguments would be:
.IP
harpwise listen richter c blues
.RE

this does listen to your playing, while marking notes from the
blues-scale.  However, relying on defaults, this could also be written
shorter as:
.IP
harpwise listen blues   
.RE

or shorter:
.IP
harpwise listen c
.RE

as 'blues' and 'c' are also the defaults, one might be tempted to
write even shorter:
.IP
harpwise listen
.RE
but that would (on purpose) produce the usage-message of mode listen.

This example would listen especially for the first three notes of the
blues-scale, which are given as arguments and form an adhoc scale:

  harpwise listen -2 -3 +4


The possible scales depend on the chosen type of harmonica:

<%=types_with_scales%>

Note that advanced users may try to create their own scales, see usage
of mode tools for an example

.SH "OPTIONS"

Besides the arguments for type, key and scale, there are a lot of
options (introduced by '-' or '--'), some requiring an argument
themselves.  Options are specific for each mode and are described on
request, i.e. if you give the special option '-o'.

Also note, that for most modes, the behaviour of the wise (e.g. the
ways of display or comment) can be changed interactively; type 'h' to
see help on this.

The wise offers a broad set of features that can support your practice for
a long time. However, it also has its limitations: The wise recognizes
single notes and it may play chords for you, but it can not identify your
chords. It knows a bit about tempo, but has no notion of rhythm.

.SH "USER CONFIGURATION"

.SH "COMMANDLINE OPTIONS"

Options are specific for each mode; as an example you may type

.IP
harpwise listen -o
.RE

to read options for mode listen.

.SH "DIAGNOSIS"

Harpwise uses the excellent program sox (aka play, aka rec) to
interact with your sound system. Sox handles all playing and
recording of sounds.

However, sometimes, sox might not be configured correctly out of the
box. If you feel, that sox (and therefore harpwise) has problems
with sounds or if you see spurious error messages, you may invoke:
  
.IP
harpwise tools diag
.RE

to execute two basic tests and get some advice.

.SH "QUICK START"
