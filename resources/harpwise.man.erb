.SH "NAME"

.B harpwise
- practice harmonica with your microphone and speaker

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.B harpwise
.RB {MODE}
.RB {ARGUMENTS}
.RB [OPTIONS]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B harpwise
('wise' for short) supports the daily practice of scales,
intervals, licks or bends on a diatonic (richter) or chromatic
harmonica for various keys.

The wise recognizes single notes, that you play and it may play chords
for you (but can not identify your chords); it knows a thing or two
about tempo, but not about rhythm.

The primary documentation of harpwise is its usage information, that
can be retrieved by calling it without arguments:
.IP
harpwise
.RE

this man page has the very same information (so you may keep on
reading ...); but there are more usage information for the individual
modes, which are not available as man-pages (see below, on how to get
them).

.SH "MODE"

When invoking harpwise, the first argument on the commandline
specifies the mode of operation; it can be one of:
.IP - 2
.B listen:
The wise listens to your playing (e.g. for scales or bends)
and helps to steer through a chord progression
.IP -
.B quiz:
Train your ear, memory and knowledge of music theory with many
different flavours. This is actually a fun way to start.
.IP -
.B licks: 
Learn licks (some included, pointers for more) as a
starting point for improvisations.
.RE

And, less interactive:

.IP - 2
.B play: 
Wise plays scales, holes, licks, intervals, chords, etc.
.IP -
.B print:
print and annotate the holes of scales or licks given on the commandline.
Also print various informationo about licks, scales and much more
.IP -
.B tools: 
Some simple, non-interactive tools related to basic harmonica theory		
.IP -
.B samples:
The wise assists in recording your own samples or generates them for
you; this is a prerequisite for using many other modes, so you will be
asked to invoke it, when necessary. Note, that for convenience, type 'richter'
and key of 'c' does not require this, as the relevant
samples are already included.
.RE

to read more details, usage examples and options for the individual
modes, invoke them without arguments, e.g.
.IP
harpwise listen
.RE

.SH "ARGUMENTS"

After the first argument (which specifies the mode) some additional
arguments may be given:
.IP - 2
.B type:
mostly 'richter' or 'chromatic' but other choices might be defined. If
omitted, this defaults to 'richter'.
.IP -
.B KEY: 
key of harp, e.g. 'c' or 'g' or 'af' (a flat) or 'ds' (d sharp). If
omitted, this defaults to 'c'.
.IP -
.B SCALE:
scale on which you want to concentrate, e.g. 'blues', 'major_pentatonic'
or 'all'; defaults to 'blues'.

Note, that most scales are notated in second position (e.g. key of g
for a c-harp); you may use the option --transpose-scale to change
this.

Finally, as a special case (and only for modes listen, quiz and licks)
you may specify a set of holes (e.g. +1 +2 +3) as an adhoc scale.

See the usage of mode 'listen' for an advanced example involving
an adhoc scale and fourth position.
.RE

An example using all these arguments would be:
.IP
harpwise listen richter c blues
.RE

this does listen to your playing, while marking notes from the
blues-scale.  However, relying on defaults, this could also be written
shorter as:
.IP
harpwise listen blues   
.RE

or shorter:
.IP
harpwise listen c
.RE

as 'blues' and 'c' are also the defaults, one might be tempted to
write even shorter:
.IP
harpwise listen
.RE
but that would (on purpose) produce the usage-message of mode listen.

This example would listen especially for the first three notes of the
blues-scale, which are given as arguments and form an adhoc scale:

  harpwise listen -2 -3 +4


The possible scales depend on the chosen type of harmonica:

<%=types_with_scales%>
  
.SH "OPTIONS"

Besides the arguments for type, key and scale, there are a lot of
options (introduced by '-' or '--'), some requiring an argument
themselves.  Options are specific for each mode and are describe, if
you give the special option '-o'.

Also note, that for most modes, the behaviour (e.g. the kind of
display) of the wise can be changed interactively; type 'h' to see
help on this.

.SH "COMMANDLINE OPTIONS"

Options are specific for each mode; as an example you may type

.IP
harpwise listen -o
.RE

to read options for mode 'listen' (e.g.).

.SH "DIAGNOSIS"

Harpwise uses the excellent program sox (aka play, aka rec) to
interact with your sound system. Sox handles all playing and
recording of sounds.

However, sometimes, sox might not be configured correctly out of the
box. If you feel, that sox (and therefore harpwise) has problems
with sounds or if you see spurious error messages, you may invoke:
  
.IP
harpwise tools diag
.RE

to execute two basic tests and get some advice.

.SH "QUICK START"
